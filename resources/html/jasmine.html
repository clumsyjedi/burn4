<b>Jasmine Beth</b> writes and sings folk tales about sailors, devils, ancient Greek legends, Shakespearean characters and madness. Audiences enjoy her jazzy vocal stylings, stripped back guitar and warm stage presence. She spends most of her time on the road, touring Australia and the UK every year. In 2014, she was a finalist in the Australian Songwriting Contest and, in 2010, runner up in the Sydney Singer-Songwriters’ Competition. Please come prepared to drink more red wine than really necessary.
