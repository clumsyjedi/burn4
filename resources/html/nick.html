In the early mornings, Mittagong-based <b>Nick Rheinberger</b> is an ABC radio presenter. But in the evenings, Nick's other side comes out, and he's leading big blues bands, small jazz combos and looping himself silly with an assortment of instruments. Poems may come out, as well as audience participation and possibly some children's songs. Be prepared.
