A prolific songwriter with a diverse pool of influences including the likes of Patty Griffin, Jane Tyrell and Kirsten Hersh, Justine is definitely someone to be watched as she pokes her head up in the Sydney alt country-roots-folk scene with a fresh take defying stereotypes and a voice that captivates and inspires.

Her debut album, “A Long Way From Home” was awarded the Anthony Lycenco Best Album Award at the Nimbin Roots ARMAs in 2017.

With this album and an EP, “Conversations with Crows” under the belt, Justine launched her latest single “Bird Song” on February 24th 2018. Bird Song was recorded by Michael Carpenter, who also produced a film clip beautifully illustrating the heart felt tale of a woman emerging from the grief of love lost to find the love gained.

Currently a digital release Bird Song will also appear as a bonus track on up and coming full length album “A Pair of Dreamers”. due out in late 2018 to be produced by Paul Greene.
