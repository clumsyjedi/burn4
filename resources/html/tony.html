<div class="w3-center"><b>Tony Wilson</b> - Tony started out playing in pubs in the Blue Mtns at the age of 15â€¦and has been playing music ever since. The weekly Bundeena Open Mic nights were started by Tony & Phil Gissing in 2004, and many fantastic musical combos have evolved from this.  He has a wealth of musical material (modern blues/rock), and is apparently one of the best purveyors of Oz Rock in the nation (thanks Frazer!)!</div>
