I WON A SMOKER. So it seems like a good idea for us all to share in delicious smoked meats. Imma prepare a brisket or something similar for us all to share on Firday night. And I might make another one for Saturday night but y'all have to keep your kids away from the scalding heat for that to be feasible lol.

. It's all included as part of your ticket price, but it will be first come, first served.

But this is not a fully catered festival. You need to bring enough food to feed yourself or else you will be so so hungry by Monday morning. We encourage you to prepare and share food on site - there are pizza ovens, BBQs and a full kitchen for all who need them. Or prepare delicious camp food on or in the fire.

        <p></p>

    <p>For those who are new to this, let me fill you in on how this works. Burn By Night is Australia's most exclusive festival, providing a smorgasbord of live music under the Goulburn night sky, for a fraction of the cost of one of those fancy pants city festivals. If you're seeing this post, that means you made the cut and are officially invited.</p>

    <p>The festival takes place on the beautiful Goulburn Yurt Farm. By day this place is a hobby farm aimed at kids so the festival is kid and family friendly. If you're curious what a Yurt Farm is, well, I'm glad you asked. It's one of those Smurf houses in the title picture of this FB event. That's right - if you get in quick you can secure one of these perfect little cottages for yourself. Some have wee kitchens, some have working fireplaces, all of them are fantastic.</p>

    <p>An average yurt sleeps around 6 adults, and spaces are limited, so please get in fast if you want to secure a yurt berth.</p>

    <p>And hey if Smurfs freak you out, you can pay less to sleep in your own tent or campervan. Camping spaces are UNLIMITED!!!</p>

      <h4><b>what to bring</b></h4>
      <div class="w3-content w3-justify" style="max-width:600px">

          <p>Hey everyone, see below a list of useful information on essentials to bring and details of some of the commodities the farm has to offer:</p>

          <p>What to bring:</p>
          <ol>
              <li>Bring your tickets. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/burn-by-night-2018-tickets-39417515851">You buy your tickets here</a> and you can print them out from the eventbrite website. If you forget your tickets, it's ok. The kid on the door will have your name on hand. If you don't buy ticket's you'll have to buy them at the gate, so you'll need cash, we cant take cards at the gate. It will make your entry (fnar) go so much smoother if you buy your tickets in advance and print them out.</li>
              <li>Water.</li>
              <li>Food. You have to eat dude. So bring food for yourself for the weekend. It's really nice if you can bring something to share as well, people get a kick out of that. On Saturday there will be some hot dogs for sale thanks to the hawt dawgs from Gypsy Journey, but they'll disappear fast I guarantee.</li>
              <li>Esky and ice.  Please bring lots of ice (there're no fridges and electricity)</li>
              <li>Torch/lamps</li>
              <li>Camping bedding.</li>
              <li>Festival (rain) poncho (just in case)</li>
              <li>Toilet paper. Oh my god, how important is this? Imagine if you forgot to bring toilet paper and you had to go tent to tent asking to borrow a few squares from each tent. That would be mortifying. Go put the toilet paper in the back of the car now while you think about it.</li>
              <li>A tent if you require one. If you didn't book and pay for a yurt already then you require one.</li>
              <li>Wellies. Or stilletos. Your call. It's a farm though.</li>
              <li>Insect repellent</li>
              <li>First aid supplies</li>
              <li>Something warm</li>
              <li>Bin bags. We ask that everyone leaves the farm as we found it. Please take as much of your own rubbish away with you.</li>
              <li>Camping chairs and rugs if you require</li>

              <p>There are a few saucepans and utensils in the little camping kitchen so you may find something to cook with or in. </p>

              <p>There will be open fires, a BBQ and pizza ovens which you can use to cook on and in.</p>

              <p>I can't stress enough that you will not want to leave the yurt village to get supplies from town due to the 30 min drive, and the extreme awesomeness of the venue and talent, so ensure you bring enough food and drink to last you the weekend.</p>
