From Goulburn NSW below the foothills of the Cookbundoon Ridges and in the shadow of the revolving light of Rocky Hill comes the "Stump Jumpers" band of Americana Country players who share a love of singing and playing music.
<p>
Formed in 2015 sitting and singing on the veranda of the Goulburn Club, the band consists of Greg Angus (guango &amp; vocals) originally from Rotterdam New York and Griz Kitchener (slide dobro) originally from Swinging sixties London. Together they play loose arrangements of favourite songs affectionately referred to as their "music with the dirt left on!"
