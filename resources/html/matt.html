<div class="w3-center"><b>Matt Thomson</b> - Since composing and performing the music for the sell-out season of indie theatre hit 'Macondo's Clothesline' last year, Matt has been hard at work creating new solo material. Matt's songs have been described as having a rare tenderness and poignancy. In addition to his own material, Matt also performs songs that he's co-written with lyricist Eli Desovska. The result is a richly varied collection of original gems, with an indie-folk bent.</div>
