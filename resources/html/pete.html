Pete Fenwick has been performing in the local scene of Sydney for around 8 years and is sounding fresher and sweeter than ever. After head lining venues such as; The Annandale Hotel, Metro Transit lounge, Landsdowne Hotel and the Hopetown Hotel, he has gathered a wealth of wisdom and experience which has brought him to his current songs and live performance. His dominant flavor through the past has been soaked with funky grooves, heart felt rhythms and lyrical unity. After his last band 'Monster stomp'; a high energy funk, scar rock band, Peter has morphed into a short and sweet package of groovy rhythms, fun and sneaky lyrics with an intense performing show that can only be expressed with a raw acoustic guitar and an old Australian amp ( a Leonard ).
