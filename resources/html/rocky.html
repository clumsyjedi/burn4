From Goulburn NSW below the foothills of the Cookbundoon Ridges and in the shadow of the revolving light of Rocky Hill comes the "Rocky Hill Billies" band of four Americana Country players who share a love of singing and playing music.
<p>
Formed in 2015 sitting and singing on the veranda of the Goulburn Club, the band consists of Faith White (guitar &amp; vocals) originally form the good ole" US of A;  Greg Angus (guango &amp; vocals) originally from Rotterdam New York; Ron McLaughlin (guitar and vocals) originally from Sydney, NSW and Griz Kitchener (slide dobro) originally from Swinging sixties London. Together they play loose arrangements of favourite songs affectionately referred to as their "music with the dirt left on!"
