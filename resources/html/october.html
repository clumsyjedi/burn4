<b>Born in October</b>

<p>

Fresh from the Tamworth Country Music Festival, city boy Matt Thomson (vocals, guitar) and country girl Rachel Webster (vocals, guitar, ukulele and shaker!) comprise indie/folk duo Born in October. Synergistic and emotive harmonies along with wistful finger picking and splashes of unusual rhthyms will take you on a gentle carpet ride over mountain streams... After meeting at a songwriter night in Sydney in 2013 and at the wise suggestion of a much loved artist and mentor, Matt and Rachel began writing songs together, forging an instant musical connection. Look out for their new EP expected mid 2017!
