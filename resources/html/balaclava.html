    <b>Balaclava Weather</b> layer fierce vocals over dreamlike melodies to create their own brand of vandalised electronic punk. Narcotic. Uninhibited. Unapologetic. Their pop crimes explore the latitude of raw, unfiltered human emotion. They endeavour to capture the colour of the new Australian gothic.

Self-titled Balaclava Weather album set for release Winter 2017
