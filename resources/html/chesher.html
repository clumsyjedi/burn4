Fifty years to an overnight success!!   John has had the good fortune to have learned and played music in many parts of the world – Canada, US, Europe, England, Africa.   Originally from Canada, he migrated to our fair shores a few years ago and raised a family here.

He has been playing in Sydney and surrounds for a number of years and has toured northern England and Ireland on a couple of occasions.  Also managed to sneak back to Canada for a while, playing Seattle when no one was looking, and Calgary.

If you like a bit of finger picking guitar with your music, you’ll enjoy John.  Styles like Jorma Kaukonen, of Hot Tuna; Stephen Stills, of CSNY.  A bit of old blues with some just now variety.
