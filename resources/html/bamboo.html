Mr Bamboo - After over a decade of playing and nonsense, with a few years hiatus here and there due to life abroad, the Mr Bamboo trio is...well...still doing it! And why not, it makes us happy and it's free therapy.
<p>
The sounds of Mr Bamboo could be described as gypsy swing meets the likes of Tom Waits, Devo and Ween, blended into an awe inspiring daiquiri to form this amusing and highly original skank/jazz/noise/pop trio that is sweet, fulfilling, drunk and eventually sour.
<p>
Made up of Ba on Guitar and sounds, Am on Vocals and Violin and Boo on Bass/percussion/vocals and loops, Mr Bamboo produce a humorous sound that combines acoustic instruments with Lo Fi electronics. 
<p>
Mr Bamboo explores complex human traits from paranoia, relationships, cleanliness, adventure, physical expression of desire and the taboos that surround such delicate issues, all without having to resort to a shred of seriousnesses.
<p>
Mr Bamboo will either make you laugh, cry, contemplate or drunk.
<p>
Do come along. Thanks.
